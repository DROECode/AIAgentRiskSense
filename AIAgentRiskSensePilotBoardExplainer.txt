1.  AI agents now automate critical decisions—reviewing their code for embedded risks is essential to safeguard enterprise trust, data, and compliance. 

2.  Unchecked AI code can silently introduce vulnerabilities, from data leakage to unauthorized actions—routine reviews mitigate systemic risk before it scales. 

3.  As regulators move swiftly on AI oversight, demonstrating strong controls and auditability is no longer optional—it’s a license to operate. 

4.  Automated agents act continuously on our behalf; without rigorous code reviews, we lack assurance that they operate within policy, ethics, or law. 

5.  In an AI-driven enterprise, governance shifts from human intent to code logic—reviewing that logic is foundational to responsible innovation. 

6.  Cyber, legal, and reputational risks increasingly originate in AI behaviors—proactive code audits are our first line of defense. 

7.  Stakeholders expect transparency and control over how AI is used—agent code reviews help us meet that expectation with confidence and credibility.
