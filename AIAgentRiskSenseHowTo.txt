To run a **pilot risk assessment** against a directory of AI agent code using the Python framework above, you’ll need to prepare the following components:

---

  ✅ 1. **Environment Setup**

**Install Python (if not already):**

* Python 3.8+ recommended.

**Required libraries:**

```bash
pip install --upgrade openai
```

(Only needed if you wish to simulate or extend prompt detection using the OpenAI API. Not required for static analysis.)

---

  ✅ 2. **Directory Structure**

Ensure you have a directory (e.g., `agents/`) containing AI agent code files:

```
/project-root/
│
├── AIAgentRiskSenseFolderOfAgents.py         # The static scanner (from our prototype)

```

---

  ✅ 3. **Main Audit Script**



# Run the pilot
 
python AIAgentRiskSenseFolderOfAgents.py ../../awesome-llm-apps --csv results.csv
python AIAgentRiskSenseFolderOfAgents.py ../../python-ai-agent-frameworks-demos --csv results.csv

  ✅ 4. **Output / Reporting**

* Start with console output (`pprint`, `print`)
* Export to CSV or JSON for review if needed
* Optional: Generate a simple HTML or PDF report summarizing:

  * Files scanned
  * Number of issues
  * Control effectiveness rating

---

  ✅ 5. **Pilot Success Criteria**

* **Coverage:** Number of agents successfully scanned
* **Accuracy:** At least one meaningful issue identified per agent (e.g., prompt injection, lack of logging)
* **Actionability:** Findings are understandable by devs or auditors
* **Integration Feasibility:** Determine ease of embedding in CI/CD or audit process

---

  ✅ 6. **Next Steps Post-Pilot**

* Add support for `.yaml`/`.json` config parsing
* Add a scoring model for control effectiveness
* Build policy dashboards or ticket auto-generation
