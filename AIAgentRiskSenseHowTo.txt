To run a **pilot risk assessment** against a directory of AI agent code using the Python framework above, you’ll need to prepare the following components:

---

  ✅ 1. **Environment Setup**

**Install Python (if not already):**

* Python 3.8+ recommended.

**Required libraries:**

```bash
pip install --upgrade openai
```

(Only needed if you wish to simulate or extend prompt detection using the OpenAI API. Not required for static analysis.)

---

  ✅ 2. **Directory Structure**

Ensure you have a directory (e.g., `agents/`) containing AI agent code files:

```
/project-root/
│
├── audit_tool.py         # The static scanner (from our prototype)
├── agents/               # Directory with agent code
│   ├── agent1.py
│   ├── agent2.py
│   └── config.yaml
```

---

  ✅ 3. **Main Audit Script**

Update `audit_tool.py` with logic to:

* **Recursively scan `.py`, `.yaml`, `.json` files**
* Apply static analysis rules to Python files
* Optionally, scan config files for known risky patterns

Example main loop:

```python
import os

def audit_directory(directory_path):
    results = []
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(directory_path):
        for fname in files:
            fpath = os.path.join(root, fname)
            if fname.endswith(".py"):
                with open(fpath, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
                    code = f.read()
                    issues = scan_code(code)
                    for issue in issues:
                        results.append({
                            "file": fpath,
                            "line": issue["line"],
                            "rule": issue["rule"],
                            "description": issue["description"]
                        })
    return results

# Run the pilot
if __name__ == "__main__":
    from pprint import pprint
    issues_found = audit_directory("agents")
    pprint(issues_found)
```

---

  ✅ 4. **Output / Reporting**

* Start with console output (`pprint`, `print`)
* Export to CSV or JSON for review if needed
* Optional: Generate a simple HTML or PDF report summarizing:

  * Files scanned
  * Number of issues
  * Control effectiveness rating

---

  ✅ 5. **Pilot Success Criteria**

* **Coverage:** Number of agents successfully scanned
* **Accuracy:** At least one meaningful issue identified per agent (e.g., prompt injection, lack of logging)
* **Actionability:** Findings are understandable by devs or auditors
* **Integration Feasibility:** Determine ease of embedding in CI/CD or audit process

---

  ✅ 6. **Next Steps Post-Pilot**

* Add support for `.yaml`/`.json` config parsing
* Add a scoring model for control effectiveness
* Build policy dashboards or ticket auto-generation
